      <h5>
        For a job seeker, here's the big question similar to 
        the chicken and egg problem --"How can I get experience 
        when employers don't give me the opportunity to get one"?
      </h5>
      <p>
        Well, the answer is simple. Apply for an Internship. 
        Of course, it's up to your employer whether he'll give you 
        a pay allowance. Perform well and you'll get rewarded 
        through praises from employers, managers and colleagues. 
        Use these praises as good points when applying for a 
        job you like.

        I need my colleagues, university faculty members and such to give me comments.
      </h5>
      <p>
        Ask them to register as a <a href="<?php echo site_url('main/register#subscriber'); ?>">Subscriber</a>
        for them to give you comments and feedbacks about your performance.

      <h5>What's the answer to the chicken and egg problem?</h5>
      <p>
        The egg came first. Billions of years of evolution where 
        micro organisms transform into something far better species. 
        In order to protect themselves while evolving, they need 
        some kind of protection much like a cocoon for butterflies 
        or a shell for snails. Perfecting that egg evolution, 
        comes out a chicken.
